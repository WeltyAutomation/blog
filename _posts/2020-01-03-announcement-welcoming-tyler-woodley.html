Tyler Woodley is joining Welty Automation as an application engineer.<br /><br />Tyler last worked at Skyworks in Cedar Rapids involved in making amplifiers for next generation cellular devices.<br /><br />Tyler took it upon himself to learn software development in order to build applications for in-house use with RF engineering lab testing equipment data collection and analysis.<br /><br />I'm excited to begin working with Tyler on Monday and look forward building next generation machine control software with him in the HVAC OEM industry.
