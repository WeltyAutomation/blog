I had a great day at <br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mYal9ymEh0g/XQ-jUSPMW2I/AAAAAAAAAGs/tiiVOnohGZQpPwhxnsFCFZIfefApvzrmACEwYBhgL/s1600/received_1811101169035369-cropped.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1402" data-original-width="980" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mYal9ymEh0g/XQ-jUSPMW2I/AAAAAAAAAGs/tiiVOnohGZQpPwhxnsFCFZIfefApvzrmACEwYBhgL/s200/received_1811101169035369-cropped.jpg" width="139" /></a></div>SQL Saturday yesterday in Iowa City, Iowa.<br /><br />This was hosted by the I-380 PASS SQL Server User Group and they always do a fantastic job.<br /><br />There are SQL Saturday events all over the world and if you haven't been to one and have an interest in all things related to SQL Server and Azure Data Services, you really need to look into these free learning events. The volunteers do a great job and I dipped my toe in the volunteer water by being a room monitor for one of my sessions on CosmosDB.<br /><br />The icing on the cake was winning an Ember Temperature Controlled Ceramic Mug in the raffle at the end of the day.
