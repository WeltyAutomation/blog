We're seeing tremendous potential value in Virtual Commissioning.<br /><br />In the past, I was able to improve my control software with a focus on the handling of part passing through the line from coil to finished product. I was able to do this by writing up my own 2D simulator from scratch which we showcased at the Manufacturing Day we hosted at Mestek Machinery in 2012.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><i><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v-sqfdEgPPQ/XPlFjkfS5kI/AAAAAAAAAFI/a920OmuX5x85r2YoFzripNV2BHS50hH8gCK4BGAYYCw/s1600/Manufacturing%2BDay%2B2012.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="213" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v-sqfdEgPPQ/XPlFjkfS5kI/AAAAAAAAAFI/a920OmuX5x85r2YoFzripNV2BHS50hH8gCK4BGAYYCw/s320/Manufacturing%2BDay%2B2012.JPG" width="320" /></a></i></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Showing this to our state senator (Charles Grassley)</i></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i><br /></i></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe width="320" height="266" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/878wvKWZts0/0.jpg" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/878wvKWZts0?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Video we played to show the visitors&nbsp;</i></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>on tour about some of the things&nbsp;</i></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>we were using technology for</i></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>This project was a big success and greatly reduced problems we were seeing in the field for those who we upgraded with the changes.<br /><br />I wanted to take that to the next level to enable better tuning and refinement of my control software at the machine level (instead of just at the line level).<br /><br />I began generating a virtual 3D ductline within the Unity 3D game engine which is used in many game development environments. I replicated my 2D line simulation within Unity (using cubes as stand-ins for detailed models) and drove it by writing a networked interface between the game and the inputs/outputs from my actual machine control program running on actual hardware (in my office). This allowed us to interact in a very natural way with the parts on the line while seeing how the real-world program responded.<br /><br />This showed a lot of promise but at that time we had little of the product line modeled in solids.<br /><br />Times have changed since then and I was ready to re-visit these efforts when I found out about a fully integrated solution being provided by our hardware vendor. This takes things to a whole new level and promises huge payback once implemented. This enables the virtual commissioning of machinery and automation control software through something being called a "Digital Twin". Exciting times!
