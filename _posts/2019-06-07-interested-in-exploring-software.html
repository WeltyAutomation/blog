Glad to hear about your interest.<br /><br />Here’s a link to some free training courses on Pluralsight:<br /><a href="https://learn.pluralsight.com/resource/free-course/free-weekly-course" target="_blank">https://learn.pluralsight.com/resource/free-course/free-weekly-course</a><br /><br />This is a good resource too:<br /><a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/</a><br /><br />This one from Microsoft Virtual Academy is free (and perhaps a bit dry): <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169" target="_blank">https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169</a><br /><br />Udemy.com is a good resource I’m told. Here’s a link to their Development section: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/courses/development/" target="_blank">https://www.udemy.com/courses/development/</a><br /><br />My son vouches for Mosh Hamedani's C# for Beginners course:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/moshfeghhamedani/">https://www.udemy.com/user/moshfeghhamedani/</a><br />He also operates his own site:&nbsp;<a href="https://programmingwithmosh.com/" target="_blank">https://programmingwithmosh.com/</a><br /><br />I tend to use Pluralsight.com which comes with a free month to explore it. Scott Allen has authored great courses on Microsoft stuff in Pluralsight. You could search for him on that site and find plenty. He’s got a good teaching style. He’s got a blog site here: <a href="https://odetocode.com/" target="_blank">https://odetocode.com/</a><br /><br />I would also encourage you to become familiar with using git (Version Control Software).<br /><br />A great tutorial on git can be found here: <a href="http://gitimmersion.com/" target="_blank">http://gitimmersion.com/</a> (It talks about using the Ruby programming language but you don’t need to install Ruby or be familiar with it… they just use Ruby source code files as examples).<br /><br />There is an excellent free eBook on git too:&nbsp;<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2</a><br /><br /><a href="https://www.blogger.com/"><span id="goog_1039122977"></span>Git</a>&nbsp;is something you’ll want to use for a lot of things… it’s quite a powerful tool and I’m finding more and more value in it week after week of using it. Quite impressive.<br /><br />I like to use Git Extensions for Windows:&nbsp;<a href="https://gitextensions.github.io/" target="_blank">https://gitextensions.github.io/</a><br /><br />I believe that will walk you through everything you need but it will depend on git and something like kdiff being installed. I just use their defaults and follow their installation recommendations.<br /><br />If you run into problems with any of these let me know. I'm happy to help.<br /><div><br /></div>
